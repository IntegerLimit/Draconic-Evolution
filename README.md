Draconic-Evolution
==================

Draconic Evolution adds powerful new tools, Items, weapons and Armor. The premise is the enigmatic ore - Draconium. As you progress you find it has many uses from the mundane such as machines and items, to the near-mystical at the top with Awakened Draconium to make extremely powerful armor and tools.

This is made for nomi-ceu, and requires GT as a dependency. However, custom GT blocks, with names "draconium" and "awakened_draconium", are required for this to work properly.

You can now use GT blocks, and Draconic Evolution Blocks, in the Energy Storage Core!

How:
Moves energy core structure to IBlockState, as well as adding a fallback block. Then, CT generated GT materials, "draconium" and "awakened_draconium" were inserted into the structure instead. Finally, appropriate adjustments were made to finalize the project, however, the build guide is still broken.

Note: if players de-activate and then reactivate their old core twice, the Draconic Evolution blocks will turn into their GT counterparts.
