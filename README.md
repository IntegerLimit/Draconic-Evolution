Draconic-Evolution
==================

Draconic Evolution adds powerful new tools, Items, weapons and Armor. The premise is the enigmatic ore - Draconium. As you progress you find it has many uses from the mundane such as machines and items, to the near-mystical at the top with Awakened Draconium to make extremely powerful armor and tools.

This is made for nomi-ceu, and requires a very specific environment to work. Note: It will definately crash at the moment.
